- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ocinom
- 👀 I’m interested in all things IT, particularly programming and cybersecurity
- 🌱 I’ve dabbled in Python, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript. Currently, I'm picking up Rust as I find that there are many lower level concepts that I have not wrapped my head around yet
- 💞️ Criticism is welcome. Be nice please
- 📫 How to reach me : right here
